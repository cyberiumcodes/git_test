                        Kobe Bean Bryant (/ˈkoʊbiː/ KOH-bee; August 23, 1978 – January 26, 2020) was an American
                        professional basketball player. As a shooting guard, Bryant entered the National Basketball
                        Association (NBA) directly from high school, and played his entire 20-season professional career
                        in
                        the league with the Los Angeles Lakers. Bryant won many accolades: five NBA championships,
                        18-time
                        All-Star, 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team, 2008 NBA
                        Most Valuable Player (MVP), two-time NBA Finals MVP winner. Widely regarded as one of the
                        greatest
                        players of all time,[3][4][5][6] he led the NBA in scoring during two seasons, ranks fourth on
                        the
                        league's all-time regular season scoring and all-time postseason scoring lists.

                        At 34 years and 104 days of age, Bryant became the youngest player in league history to reach
                        30,000 career points. He became the all-time leading scorer in Lakers franchise history on
                        February 1, 2010, surpassing Jerry West. Bryant was also the first guard in NBA history to play
                        at least 20 seasons. His 18 All-Star designations are the second most all time, while it is the
                        record for most consecutive appearances as a starter. Bryant's four All-Star MVP Awards are tied
                        with Bob Pettit for the most in NBA history. He gave himself the nickname "Black Mamba" in the
                        mid-2000s, and the epithet became widely adopted by the general public. At the 2008 and 2012
                        Summer Olympics, he won two gold medals as a member of the U.S. national team.
